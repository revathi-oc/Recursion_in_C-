# Recursion in C++
## Aim
To study recursion and how to implement it in C++.

## Theory
Recursion in C++ is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a larger problem. It is typically used to break down complex tasks into simpler sub-problems. Each recursive call moves closer to a base case, which is a condition where the function stops calling itself, preventing infinite recursion. Recursion is especially useful for problems that have a naturally recursive structure, such as tree traversal, factorial calculation, and solving puzzles like the Tower of Hanoi. However, improper handling can lead to issues like excessive memory use or stack overflow, so it's important to ensure a base case is always reachable and recursion depth is limited for efficiency.
